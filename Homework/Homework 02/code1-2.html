        <h1>Revelation</h1>
        <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
        <p>
            We make ourselves a place apart <br />
            &nbsp; Behind light words that tease and flout, <br />
            But oh, the agitated heart <br />
            &nbsp; Till someone find us really out. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            'Tis pity if the case require <br />
            &nbsp; (Or so we say) that in the end <br />
            We speak the literal to inspire <br />
            &nbsp; The understanding of a friend. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            But so with all, from babes that play <br />
            &nbsp; At hide-and-seek to God afar, <br />
            So all who hide too well away <br />
            &nbsp; Must speak and tell us there they are. <br />
        </p>
